什么是BOGON?
=========
Bogon is a bogus IP address and an informal name for an IP packet 
on the public Internet that claims to be from an area of the IP address 
spacereserved, but not yet allocated or delegated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
or a delegated Regional Internet Registry (RIR). The areas of unallocated 
address space are called the bogon space.

Bogon就是公网中声称来自保留网段的IP地址的伪造名称。保留网段是IANA没分配的地址段
